# Notebooks Directory - Index and Progression

This directory contains a collection of Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb) files that demonstrate the exploration and extraction of JSON data.

## Directory Structure

The Notebooks directory is organized based on the progression and complexity of the analysis. Each .ipynb file represents a stage of advancement, starting from basic code to more elegant and refined solutions. The files are structured as follows:

- [json_exploration_1.ipynb](Notebooks/B1_JSON_Exploration/json_exploration_1.ipynb): Contains initial basic code for JSON exploration.
- [json_exploration_2.ipynb](Notebooks/B1_JSON_Exploration/json_exploration_2.ipynb): Builds upon the previous notebook with additional features and analysis.
- [json_exploration_3.ipynb](Notebooks/B1_JSON_Exploration/json_exploration_3.ipynb): Showcases more advanced and refined code for in-depth exploration of the .JSON raw data.

This indexing notation applies Notebook/Directory wise
